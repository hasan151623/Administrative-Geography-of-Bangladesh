All divisions, districts, subdistricts and unions are included in the csv and json format. 
I have also inclued Django Models for division, district, subdistrict and union. 

Initially the .csv file is loaded to database using proper formatting. Then, these data are 
dumped to json format using following command,

```python
    python manage.py dumpdata --format=json appname.Model > /path/to/store/filename.json
```

When any change is occured to fixture files, 
```python				
    python manage.py loaddata /path/to/fixtures/filename.json 
 ```
command will update database with updateddata.
